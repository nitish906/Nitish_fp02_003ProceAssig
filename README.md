- Theoretical Challenge

1.) Ans:- The Challenge will be null pointer Exceptation the arithematic error.I would pass the input CSV data and Convert each cell value to either a number or a formula string. Then , I would evaluate the formulla using a revrse poslish notation algritham.

2.) Ans:-  I would check the folleing errors they are SyntexError in the formulas like arithematic Exceptation, incorrect data types, underfined variables in the formula.

3.) Ans:- A user Might break the code by Providing and incrroct format the input CSV data. and inculiding a large number of complex formulas that cause preformnce isuues and introducing mailcious formulas or variblaes in an attempt to exploit vulnebltes in the code;
